This repository contains the skeleton code for the Minesweeper Alpha project
assigned to the students in the Spring 2020 CSCI 1302 classes
at the University of Georgia. 

### Minesweeper Overview

In your Minesweeper, the player is initially presented with a grid of
undifferentiated squares. Either some randomly-selected squares or seed-selected
squares (more on seeds later) are designated to contain mines. The
size of the grid and the number of mines are set in advance by a
seed file that the user specifies as a command-line argument to your
program. The ratio of the number of mines to the grid size is often used as a
measure of an individual game's difficulty. The grid size can also be
represented in terms of the number of rows and columns in the grid.
In this project description, we may refer to the _grid_ or to the
_minefield_. Both of these terms mean the same thing. Furthermore,
we will use the term _square_ to denote a location in the minefield, even
in situations where a location may be visually rectangular instead
of perfectly square.
